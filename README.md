I have no idea what to put here.

If you want to run it, natively, open a shell/terminal/cmd

type "cd wwwroot/"
type "npm install"
type "npm start run"

If you want to host on a web page, put the files that aren't in a folder in the root of the server, then put the wwwroot/ folder onto the root (keep files in wwwroot/)
